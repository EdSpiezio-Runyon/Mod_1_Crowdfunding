# UTSA 01: Crowdfunding

## Background
Crowdfunding has become a popular way for individuals and organizations to raise money for their projects. However, not all projects are successful in meeting their funding goals. This project aims to analyze a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to identify any trends or factors that may contribute to a project's success.

## Data Source
The data used in this analysis was obtained from Kickstarter, a popular crowdfunding platform. The dataset contains information on 1,000 Kickstarter projects, including the project name, category, funding goal, pledged amount, and project outcome.

## Analysis
The dataset was cleaned and processed using Python and the Pandas library. Descriptive statistics were calculated to gain insights into the distribution of the data. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between the variables and identify any trends.

The analysis focused on identifying factors that may contribute to a project's success, including the project category, funding goal, and project duration. Logistic regression was used to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a project's success based on these factors.

## Results
The analysis revealed several trends and factors that may contribute to a project's success. Projects in the categories of Music, Film & Video, and Games had the highest success rates. Projects with lower funding goals and shorter project durations were also more likely to be successful.

The logistic regression model had an accuracy of 68%, indicating that it is a moderately effective tool for predicting project success.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that there are several factors that can increase the likelihood of a project's success on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. By understanding these factors, individuals and organizations can make more informed decisions when launching their projects and increase their chances of meeting their funding goals.
